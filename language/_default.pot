msgid "A GENDEX file is an index of personal data and a short page URL. It is used to index a genealogical website by a genealogical search engine. The idea behind it is to join numerous pedigrees of individual genealogical researchers to a central database, while the individual genealogical researchers are still keeping  all control over their data. Unlike a GEDCOM file a GENDEX file contains no information about the family relationships between individuals. This means the file is useless without the corresponding website."
